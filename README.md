There are a lot of issues with my code, I know... This one took a very long time. It would've been nice to have more time to do this assignment.

I referenced StackOverflow, GeeksforGeeks, the BST German gave us in class and the DoublyLinkedList we were given.

g++ -o A6main A6main.cpp
./A6main
